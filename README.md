# Social-Media-Mining
Project for Class @IUB - Spring 2018

* We wanted to study the effect of social media on political abuse which could have affected the outcome of 2016 election.

* We mined Twitter data from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016 to study the behaviour of each tweet by Trump or Clinton and how it affected the election.

* As a final conclusion we found that none of the content in the tweets could have actually affected the election. Interestingly we found that the loudness of each tweet or loudness of a mention in a tweet actually attributed to the political outcome.
