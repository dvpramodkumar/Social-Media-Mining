# Social-Media-Mining
Project for Class @IUB - Spring 2018

* We wanted to study the effect of social media on political abuse which could have affected the outcome of 2016 election.

* We mined Twitter data from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016 to study the behaviour of each tweet by Trump or Clinton and how it affected the election.

* We have pre-processed the tweets and used Afinn score to identify the negativity of each tweet, which we used to find the relation between tweet and the effect it had on users. We fit a few models on the data to see the correlation between the tweets.

* As a final conclusion we found that none of the content in the tweets could have actually affected the election. Interestingly we found that the loudness of each tweet or loudness of a mention in a tweet actually attributed to the political outcome.
